this is going to be an aggregator that searches kixify, ebay, and grailed for resellers of rare and fancy sneakers

so far, I have a python script that opens the first 10 search results from kixify - does not deal with parameters (brand, size, gender) or anything yet

eventually, it will be a website you can search with little thumbnail hover-over information from each listing (parse the page for price and a photo and used status)
